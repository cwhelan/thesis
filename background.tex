\chapter{Biological Background}\label{chap_background}

In this chapter we will explore the nature of structural variations, discuss the mechanisms that may be behind their formation, and their effect on phenotypes and disease. We will then describe high-throughput sequencing and discuss the typical informatics pipelines that researchers create to analyze sequencing data, ending with a discussion of the challenges that the increasing number and size of sequencing data sets represent.
